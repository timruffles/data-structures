This is a paragraph of prose. Testing the formatting on Github. In
Sublime Text, there is the option of wrapping paragraphs individually,
therefore selectively allowing code not to be wrapped. But it would be
cool if this is done smartly and automatically by the CoffeeScript
plugin. Also, currently the highlighting is screwed up. Just submitted
litcoffee support suggestion to the plugin developer.

Below is an actual piece of code

	number1 = 5
	number2 = 10

The line of code below should not wrap. This works well with markdown,
since code and paragraphs can be separated by a double line break.

	console.log number1 + number2 + number1 + number2 + number1 + number2 + number1 + number2 + number1 + number2 + number1 + number2

More normal lines here.
